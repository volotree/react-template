# React + Vite

## React Laravel Blog Website
This project is a full-stack blog website built using React for the front end and Laravel for the back end. The purpose of this website is to provide a platform where users can easily create, edit, update, and manage blog posts. The front end is designed with React to ensure a dynamic, responsive user interface, while the back end is powered by Laravel, which serves as a RESTful API to handle all the server-side operations.

The seamless integration between React and Laravel provides a smooth user experience and efficient data management. This website demonstrates how to leverage both technologies to build a modern, feature-rich blog application.
